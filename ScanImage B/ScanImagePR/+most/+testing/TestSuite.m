    properties (Abstract, Constant)
        classUnderTest; % An evaluable expression pointing to the class/program being tested.

    properties (Access=protected)
        hTestFixture; % A handle to the constructed object of the class under test.
        tests; % A map containing all tests in this test suite.

    properties (Hidden, Access=protected)

                 % If false, 'classUnderTest' will be evaluated, but no object handle will be expected or stored.
