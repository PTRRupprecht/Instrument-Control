29.10.10 Fixed: Could not abort ftp upload while retrying 3 times (e.g. because target was write protected)
27.10.10 Fixed: Watch directory changes: When receiving notification about file rename and both old and new name exist in the list, then remove the old name from the list

17.10.10 Fixed: Copy names with path to clipboard sometimes exported drives as uppercase after search - feed to listbox
17.10.10 Fixed: Increased maximum possible stack size from 1/4 to 1/2 MByte, otherwise some plugins like ShellDetails may crash on load

15.10.10 Added: Calculate occupied space: Show size also in kBytes, MBytes and GBytes
15.10.10 Added: Button bar, start menu: Two new placeholders, %v and %V: Adds virtual file name (%v: just the name, %V: with full path) instead of redirected path to command line in plugins like Temporary panel

12.10.10 Fixed: Windows 7 theme for Vista (with patched uxtheme.dll) causes distorted headers (Name, Ext, Size etc)

05.10.10 Fixed: Directory hotlist: cd ftp://user:pass@server.com/path/ didn't work if the user name or password contained an asterisk (*) character (make sure the path ends with a slash to make it work)
05.10.10 Fixed: Regular expressions, Unicode (e.g. in multi-rename tool): Disallow pattern ^?? because it causes a crash (replace by ^? as for ANSI regex searches)
01.10.10 Fixed: Drag&Drop from search->feed to listbox not working on network shares. Now it should work when all selected files are on the same share (\\server\share)
30.09.10 Fixed: Don't check for shield overlay icon on UNC paths because it seems to be very slow
30.09.10 Fixed: File lists: Cache per file icons again, so they show up immediately when they were shown before, but always reload them in the background thread
30.09.10 Fixed: Lister didn't support case-insensitive backwards search in UTF-8 files
30.09.10 Fixed: Start editing comment (Ctrl+Z) while background packing of TGZ archive active, save comment (F2) -> access violation (only occurs when 'watch directory changes' is off)
30.09.10 Fixed: Archive with encrypted file names (e.g. RAR): Pressed F3 on <Encrypted -> F5> text -> error message was shown, but cursor remained an hourglass
30.09.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs - "compare plugins" configuration dialog: First column wasn't cut off at start of second column

28.09.10 Fixed: FTP: User had to re-enter server password (instead of master password) after closing TC with ftp connection on different tab, when this tab was locked with directory changes allowed
28.09.10 Fixed: Create CRC checksums, give name of existing directory as target file name -> Error that controls were deleted in background thread
28.09.10 Fixed: Windows Vista/7: Do not follow junctions (reparse points) located on network drives when the target drive differs, because the stored target is an absolute path, so the redirection would go to a local directory
28.09.10 Fixed: RAR packer: -sfx was passed twice to the packer when creating self-extracting archives
28.09.10 Fixed: Verify CRC checksums: Could not abort verification while no files were found to be checked, e.g. because the crc file was moved to a different directory
28.09.10 Fixed: Documentation of E_BAD_DATA and E_BAD_ARCHIVE in packer plugin help file was wrong (reversed)
28.09.10 Fixed: FTP master password not working when longer than 64 bytes (after converting it to UTF-8 internally)
28.09.10 Fixed: Show extended context menu items also in "x64" submenu on 64-bit systems when Shift is pressed while the context menu (not the x64 submenu) is opened
27.09.10 Fixed: Configuration - Change button bar: Icons appeared on multiple lines when using high dpi settings (e.g. 175 dpi)
27.09.10 Fixed: Delete directories, one of them is locked because it's the current dir in another program -> user closes program, clicks "retry" -> only that directory is deleted, but the delete operation stops
27.09.10 Fixed: Also ignore trailing spaces in XXE-Encoded files
27.09.10 Fixed: Select files (Num+"+"): Function couldn't handle selection by size properly for files > 2GB

26.09.10 Fixed: When using "watch directory changes" and closing Word, some temporary files didn't disappear from the list (because watching for list changes was temporarily suspended) -> do not suspend it when staying in same dir
26.09.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs: "Read Error" message was shown when comparing directory with empty drive (e.g. newly formatted USB stick)
26.09.10 Fixed: Handle faulty ftp servers which return Unix file listing in reply to MLSD command (instead of MLSD format)

24.09.10 Fixed: FTP: Store flag to preserve file dates on upload in separate ini entry (PreserveDatesUpload) from same option for downloads

24.09.10 Fixed: Search dialog, find text: Storing of Unicode text with spaces at start or end not working
24.09.10 Fixed: FTP download from list, list >1024 bytes, edit list during download -> crash
31.08.10 Added: Start work on 64-bit conversion
29.08.10 Fixed: F4 Edit: Do not try to run default editor notepad.exe from current directory (if just notepad.exe is defined as default editor)

04.07.10 Fixed: Background transfer manager: Speed limit could be significantly lower than chosen by the user
02.07.10 Fixed: FTP: Made the detection of UTF-8 encoding compliant with RFC 2640: If the FEAT command returns a line with UTF8, the encoding is ON by default, even if OPTS UTF8 ON returns an error
02.07.10 Fixed: Load per file icons (e.g. exe/lnk) always in background, not only on first load (should make network drives more responsive)
02.07.10 Fixed: When deleting files as admin from system32 while x64DisableRedirection=1, redirect calls to tcmadmin to SysNative (will work on XP64 only when installing Microsoft patch)

28.06.10 Fixed: Show error when user tries to use outdated diskdir extended plugin

27.06.10 Fixed: TAR archives: Unpack files with long name stored in pax (portable archive interchange) format extended header (see The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6, IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition)
27.06.10 Fixed: Send OPTS MLST command when server doesn't send all fields by default (e.g. UNIX.mode)

27.06.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs with files which differ only in case: Re-alignment stopped after the first matching file
27.06.10 Added: Allow user to choose whether Ctrl+C should use Explorer extensions or not (default is no, it's much faster): wincmd.ini [Configuration] UseFastCtrlC=1/0  (Set to 0 to use Explorer extensions)

25.06.10 Added: Synchronize dirs with files which differ only in case: show slashed circle for files which will not be synchronized

23.06.10 Added: Drive button bar: Do not show USB card reader slots with no media: wincmd.ini [Configuration] HideRemovableNoMedia=1  (NT-based systems only, turn off when too slow)
23.06.10 Fixed: Upload of subdir to FTP failed if connection was lost (timeout) before the upload started
22.06.10 Fixed: Dynamically create copyright notice with Unicode in Splash screen so it also works on e.g. Chinese Windows

15.06.10 Added: Call network connect function with CONNECT_PROMPT option to prompt for user name: wincmd.ini [Configuration] PromptForUser=1
15.06.10 Fixed: FTP: When "Send commands" also contained a CWD command, reconnecting to an ftp server via history went to that directory instead of the directory in the history
14.06.10 Fixed: Problems with tabs when an ftp connection was saved with "@" character in its name (TC tries to reconnect on each tab change)
13.06.10 Added: "cd" command in button bar and user menu: When parameter /user: is added without giving a user name, call connect function with CONNECT_PROMPT option to prompt for user name
13.06.10 Fixed: Look for key file also under %LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore on Windows Vista/7 if TC is installed in "Program files" dir (reason: some older mail programs may store the key there!)

31.05.10 Added: Synchronize dirs with FTP when files with same name but different case exist, e.g. index.htm + INDEX.HTM -> just show these files in red and ignore them (can be viewed or deleted)
31.05.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs: No subdirectory headers were shown when using "Only selected" with some selected dirs, but "Recurse subdirs" turned off (which compares files in these dirs, but not their subdirs)

21.11.08  Fixed: Search function: Regex search ignored empty search string (bug in Regexpr library) -> assume .*

21.11.08  Fixed: Access violation when adding too many files to command line with Shift+Drag&Drop
29.10.08  Fixed: Auto-resume upload could restart at position 0 of the file if the server or connection was very slow, and didn't support the SIZE command
